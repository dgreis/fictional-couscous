This is a mock-up eCommerce site using the MEAN stack
It is from a course at MongoDB University that I completed on 7/18/17.

To see MongoMart in action:

Download the MongoMart.
Install the dependencies.
Make sure you have a mongod running version 3.2.x of MongoDB.
Import the "item" collection: mongoimport --drop -d mongomart -c item data/items.json
Import the "cart" collection: mongoimport --drop -d mongomart -c cart data/cart.json
Run the application by typing "node mongomart.js" in the mongomart directory.
In your browser, visit http://localhost:3000.
